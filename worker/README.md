# Splot Photo Upload Worker

A Cloudflare Worker that handles photo uploads with geolocation metadata extraction and PMTiles serving for the Splot project.

## What it does

- **Upload Form Interface**: Serves a web form on GET requests for uploading photos
- **Photo Processing**: Accepts JPEG image uploads via POST requests
- **EXIF Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts GPS coordinates and other metadata from photos
- **R2 Storage**: Stores photos in Cloudflare R2 bucket with comprehensive metadata
- **PMTiles Serving**: Serves vector map tiles from PMTiles archives stored in R2
- **CORS Support**: Includes CORS headers for web compatibility

## Features

### Upload Form (GET requests)
- Clean, responsive HTML interface with dark theme
- File validation (JPEG only)
- Progress feedback and error handling
- Mobile-friendly design

### Photo Upload Processing (POST requests)
- Validates JPEG file uploads
- Extracts geolocation metadata using EXIF data
- Stores photos in R2 bucket "globe" with metadata including:
  - GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude)
  - Camera information (make, model)
  - Timestamp data
  - File metadata (size, type, original name)
- Returns JSON response with upload status and location info

### PMTiles Processing (GET requests to /tiles/*)
- Serves vector map tiles from PMTiles archives stored in R2 bucket "tiles"
- Provides TileJSON metadata endpoints for map client configuration
- Supports individual tile serving with proper MIME types and caching
- Built-in CORS support for web map integration
- Based on the official protomaps/PMTiles serverless implementation

## Files

- `src/index.js` - The main worker code (photo upload and form serving)
- `src/pmtiles.js` - PMTiles serving functionality for vector map tiles
- `wrangler.toml` - Cloudflare Worker configuration with R2 bucket bindings
- `package.json` - Worker dependencies including exifr for EXIF extraction and pmtiles for tile serving

## Setup

To deploy this worker, you need to configure GitHub Secrets and R2 bucket:

1. **CF_WORKERS** - Your Cloudflare API Token
   - Create at: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
   - Use the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
   - Ensure it has permissions: `Zone:Zone Settings:Read`, `Zone:Zone:Read`, `Account:Cloudflare Workers:Edit`

2. **CF_ACCOUNT_ID** - Your Cloudflare Account ID
   - Found in the Cloudflare dashboard right sidebar
   - Or visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/ and copy the Account ID

3. **R2 Bucket Setup**
   - Create an R2 bucket named "globe" in your Cloudflare account
   - Create an R2 bucket named "tiles" in your Cloudflare account
   - The buckets are automatically bound to the worker as `GLOBE` and `TILES`

## Deployment

The worker is automatically deployed when:
- Changes are pushed to the `main` branch in the `worker/` directory
- Or manually triggered via GitHub Actions

The deployment uses the GitHub secrets for authentication with Cloudflare.
